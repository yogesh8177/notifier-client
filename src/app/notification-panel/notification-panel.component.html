    <h3>Working of app</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Top right heading of the notification panel turns dark green when connected to server, turns red otherwise!</li>
        <li>If you submit job and wait for 3 seconds before expanding notification panel, then you can see count of unseen notifications!</li>
        <li>Once you expand the notification panel, unseen notification count becomes 0 and becomes invisible!</li>
        <li>Click on notification panel to expand and/or collapse it!</li>
        <li>Each job contains current time stamp as its ID</li>
        <li>Color codes for notifications: <strong>Orange:</strong> job submitted and pending for completion, <strong>Green:</strong> job completed successfully, <strong>Red:</strong> job failed due to web app refresh!</li>
        <li>Note that only currently submitted jobs can be stored in history, i.e after submitting a job or jobs for current session, if web app is refreshed, previous notifications are in history (LocalStorage)!</li>
        <li>If a job is submitted and web page is refreshed before job completes, then after refresh that job notification will turn <strong>red</strong> denoting that job failed!</li>
        <li>LocalStorage is used instead of session for old notification history!</li>
